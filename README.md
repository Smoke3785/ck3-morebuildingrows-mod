Simple UI mod for Crusader Kings 3 which increases the number of possible building slots in the county management UI. This is necessary with many mods, due to the fact that their special buildings do not occupy an existing _open_ slot, but add a building as if a new slot was created.

_This `window_county_view.gui` file is taken from another mod, which I cannot remember. Once I track it down, I will link it here._
